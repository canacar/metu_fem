This package is part of the EMSI Tools Package developed at the
Brain Research Laboratory, Middle East Technical University
Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

The METU-FEM forward problem solver uses PETSc library as a
parallel high performance sparse solver. The latest version
of PETSc at the time of writing is 3.6.4 and can be obtained
from: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/


Compiling:

1. Make sure that PETSc is installed and the PETSC_DIR
   environment variable is set properly. Note that PETSc
   must be compiled with C++ support. This requires adding
   --with-cxx=g++ and --with-clanguage=cxx switches when
   configuring PETSc with the configure command.

2. Run 'make' or 'gmake' under the project directory.
